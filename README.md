# Overwiew

A command-line utility for recovering assets from the raw data exported from Vault12 mobile app.

## Installation

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install the package globally:
```
$ npm i -g vault12-recovery
```
## Usage

1. Export the decryption key (`vault12.json`) from the Vault12 app: *Settings > Advanced > Export My Vaultâ€™s Decryption Key*
2. Collect the raw Vault data from several Guardian devices via *Settings > Advanced > Export Data for External Vault*. You'll need to collect the amount of files equal to the **Number of Confirmations** you selected when creating the Vault.
3. Place all exported archives and `vault12.json` file in the same directory, e.g. `~/vault12-files`.
4. In terminal, run
```
$ vault12-recovery ~/vault12-files
```
5. You should find all recovered assets from the Vault in the directory `~/vault12-files/output`.
